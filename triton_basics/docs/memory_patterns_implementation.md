# Memory Patterns Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the Triton-based implementation of various memory access patterns, demonstrating the critical importance of memory coalescing and efficient memory access patterns in GPU programming. The implementation includes coalesced access, strided access, and shared memory optimization techniques.

## Memory Access Patterns in GPU Computing

### Coalesced Memory Access

Coalesced memory access is a crucial optimization technique in GPU programming where adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations, allowing the GPU to combine multiple memory requests into a single transaction.

**Key Benefits:**
- Maximizes memory bandwidth utilization
- Reduces memory transaction overhead
- Significantly improves performance for memory-bound kernels

**Characteristics:**
- Contiguous memory access pattern
- Thread ID maps directly to memory offset
- All threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations

### Strided Memory Access

Strided access occurs when threads access memory locations with a fixed stride between them, which can lead to non-coalesced memory transactions.

**Performance Impact:**
- Lower memory bandwidth utilization
- Multiple memory transactions for single warp
- Significant performance degradation for large strides

### Shared Memory Optimization

Shared memory is a programmer-managed cache that can be used to optimize memory access patterns by:
- Reducing global memory accesses
- Enabling data reuse
- Facilitating efficient data sharing between threads

## Implementation Details

### Coalesced Access Kernel

```python
@triton.jit
def coalesced_access_kernel(
    output_ptr, input_ptr, 
    n_elements, 
    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,
):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE
    
    # Coalesced access pattern
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    mask = offsets < n_elements
    
    # Load with coalesced access
    data = tl.load(input_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)
    result = data * data
    
    # Store with coalesced access
    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, result, mask=mask)
```

### Strided Access Kernel

```python
@triton.jit
def strided_access_kernel(
    output_ptr, input_ptr, 
    n_rows, n_cols, stride,
    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,
):
    row_idx = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    col_offsets = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    
    # Strided access pattern
    row_start_ptr = input_ptr + row_idx * stride
    mask = col_offsets < n_cols
    
    # Load with strided access
    data = tl.load(row_start_ptr + col_offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)
    result = data * 2.0
    
    # Store with strided access
    tl.store(output_ptr + col_offsets, result, mask=mask)
```

### Shared Memory Kernel

```python
@triton.jit
def shared_memory_kernel(
    output_ptr, input_ptr,
    n_rows, n_cols,
    BLOCK_SIZE_M: tl.constexpr,
    BLOCK_SIZE_N: tl.constexpr,
):
    pid_m = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    pid_n = tl.program_id(axis=1)
    
    # Load data to shared memory
    shared_data = tl.zeros((BLOCK_SIZE_M, BLOCK_SIZE_N), dtype=tl.float32)
    
    # Load from global to shared memory
    for i in range(BLOCK_SIZE_M):
        for j in range(BLOCK_SIZE_N):
            if mask_m[i] and mask_n[j]:
                global_ptr = input_ptr + offsets_m[i] * n_cols + offsets_n[j]
                shared_data[i, j] = tl.load(global_ptr, other=0.0)
    
    # Process in shared memory
    for i in range(BLOCK_SIZE_M):
        for j in range(BLOCK_SIZE_N):
            shared_data[i, j] = shared_data[i, j] * 2.0 + 1.0
    
    # Store back to global memory
    for i in range(BLOCK_SIZE_M):
        for j in range(BLOCK_SIZE_N):
            if mask_m[i] and mask_n[j]:
                global_ptr = output_ptr + offsets_m[i] * n_cols + offsets_n[j]
                tl.store(global_ptr, shared_data[i, j])
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmark Results

```python
# Example benchmark results for 4096Ã—4096 matrix:
{
    'coalesced_time': 0.0012,      # 1.2ms per operation
    'strided_time': 0.0028,        # 2.8ms per operation

}
```

### Performance Analysis

**Coalesced vs Strided Access:**
- Coalesced access typically achieves **2-3x** higher memory bandwidth
- Strided access suffers from memory transaction overhead
- Performance gap increases with larger matrix sizes

**Shared Memory Benefits:**
- Reduces global memory accesses by enabling data reuse
- Provides intermediate performance between coalesced and strided access
- Particularly effective for computations requiring multiple data accesses

## Memory Access Optimization Techniques

### 1. Block Size Selection

```python
# Optimal block size calculation
BLOCK_SIZE = triton.next_power_of_2(n_elements)
BLOCK_SIZE = min(BLOCK_SIZE, 16384)  # Cap to reasonable limits
```

### 2. Memory Coalescing Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use contiguous memory access patterns
- Map thread IDs directly to memory offsets
- Process data in cache-friendly block sizes

**Avoid:**
- Random memory access patterns
- Large strides between thread accesses
- Non-contiguous memory access within warps

### 3. Shared Memory Best Practices

**Usage Patterns:**
- Load data to shared memory once, reuse multiple times
- Use shared memory for frequently accessed data
- Minimize shared memory bank conflicts

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Tile data processing to fit in shared memory
- Use appropriate block dimensions for target architecture
- Balance shared memory usage across thread blocks

## Hardware Considerations

### GPU Memory Hierarchy

**Global Memory:**
- High latency (~300-800 cycles)
- High bandwidth (~900 GB/s for A100)
- Non-cached, requires explicit management

**Shared Memory:**
- Low latency (~20-30 cycles)
- High bandwidth (~19 TB/s for A100)
- Programmer-managed cache

**Memory Transaction Size:**
- 32-byte, 64-byte, or 128-byte transactions
- Coalesced access minimizes transaction overhead
- Strided access may trigger multiple transactions

### Architecture-Specific Optimizations

**NVIDIA Ampere (A100):**
- 128 KB shared memory per SM
- 128-byte memory transactions
- L2 cache: 40 MB

**NVIDIA Hopper (H100):**
- 228 KB shared memory per SM
- Enhanced memory coalescing
- Thread block clusters

```

## Common Issues and Solutions

- Use shared memory for frequently accessed data

## Advanced Topics

### Memory Coalescing in Higher Dimensions

For 2D and 3D tensors, memory coalescing requires careful consideration of stride patterns:

```python
# Good: Row-major access
for i in range(BLOCK_SIZE_M):
    for j in range(BLOCK_SIZE_N):
        offset = row_start + j  # Contiguous within rows

# Bad: Column-major access
for j in range(BLOCK_SIZE_N):
    for i in range(BLOCK_SIZE_M):
        offset = row_start + i * stride  # Strided access
```

### Asynchronous Memory Operations

Triton supports asynchronous memory operations for overlapping computation and memory transfers:

```python
# Load data asynchronously
async_copy = tl.load_async(input_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
# Perform computation
result = computation()
# Synchronize before using loaded data
tl.wait(async_copy)
```

### Tensor Core Optimization

For modern GPUs, tensor cores can provide significant speedup for matrix operations:

```python
# Use tl.dot for tensor core operations
accumulator += tl.dot(a_block, b_block, allow_tf32=True)
```
